Please alter the implementation roadmap called docs/proj/prodcat.md wih the following Replit Object Storage solution information. I used this approach in another project whic worked well for my e-commerce product listings application. The implementation should follow the architecture as below.

Specifically, I need you to:

1. Setup and configuration:
   - Install the @replit/object-storage package
   - Create an organized storage structure with folders for:
     * public assets (product images, category thumbnails)

2. Core storage service:
   - Create an objectstore.ts service module with the following functions:
     * uploadFile: Upload files with proper metadata and content-type detection
     * getFile: Retrieve files as streams or buffers
     * deleteFile: Remove files when no longer needed
     * listFiles: List files in a directory with pagination support
     * getPublicUrl: Generate URLs for public file access
     * createFolder: Create directory structure as needed

3. Product-centric organization:
   - Implement a hierarchical structure where files are organized by:
     * /public/products/{productId}/images/
     * /public/categories/{categoryId}/
   - Handle permissions to allow unauthenticated access to /public/* files

4. Media processing capabilities:
   - Image resizing/optimization before storage
   - Generate thumbnails for product listings
   - Support multi-image products with proper ordering
   - Handle image validation (size limits, allowed formats)

5. Integration with the application:
   - Create API endpoints for file operations:
     * POST /api/files/upload - For uploads
     * GET /api/files/{path} - For file retrieval
     * DELETE /api/files/{path} - For removing files

6. Frontend components:
   - Create a reusable ImageUploader component with:
     * Drag-and-drop support
     * Multiple file selection
     * Progress indicators
     * Image preview capabilities
   - Implement a ProductImageGallery component for displaying product images

7. Security considerations:
   - Validate file types using both extension and content-type
   - Implement size limits to optimize storage use
   - Use proper error handling for all storage operations
   - Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks

The solution should be scalable, support thousands of product listings with multiple images each, and maintain good performance. Ensure that file URLs are properly constructed for public access.
