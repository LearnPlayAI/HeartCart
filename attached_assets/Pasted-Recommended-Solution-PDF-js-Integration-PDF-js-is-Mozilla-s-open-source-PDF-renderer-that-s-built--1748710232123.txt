Recommended Solution: PDF.js Integration
PDF.js is Mozilla's open-source PDF renderer that's built into most browsers and provides excellent compatibility. It's the most reliable solution for this use case.

Implementation Strategy
1. Frontend PDF Viewer Component
Create a dedicated PDF viewer component using PDF.js with these features:

Pan: Click and drag to move around the document
Zoom: Mouse wheel zoom in/out with zoom controls
Scroll: Native scrolling through multi-page documents
Page navigation: Previous/Next page buttons
Responsive: Adapts to container size
2. Component Architecture
// New component structure
PDFViewerContainer
├── PDFToolbar (zoom controls, page navigation, download)
├── PDFCanvas (main viewing area with pan/zoom)
├── PDFThumbnails (optional sidebar for page navigation)
└── PDFLoadingState (loading indicators and error handling)
3. Technical Implementation Details
PDF.js Integration Options:

PDF.js Express - Pre-built viewer with all controls
Custom PDF.js - Build custom viewer with exact features needed
react-pdf library - React wrapper around PDF.js
Recommended: Custom PDF.js Implementation

More control over UI/UX
Better integration with existing design system
Smaller bundle size (only include needed features)
4. Key Features to Implement
Core Functionality:

Load PDF from /api/orders/:id/proof endpoint
Render PDF pages as canvas elements
Implement zoom (25% to 500%)
Add pan functionality with mouse drag
Smooth scrolling between pages
Keyboard shortcuts (zoom with +/-, page navigation with arrows)
UI Controls:

Zoom in/out buttons
Fit to width/height buttons
Page input field with total page count
Download button
Fullscreen toggle
Print functionality
Error Handling:

Loading states with progress indicators
Error messages for failed PDF loads
Fallback to download link if rendering fails
Retry mechanism for network issues
5. Performance Optimizations
Lazy Loading:

Only render visible pages + 1-2 buffer pages
Unload off-screen pages to save memory
Progressive loading for large PDFs
Canvas Optimization:

Use appropriate resolution based on zoom level
Implement viewport-based rendering
Cache rendered pages in memory (with limits)
Network Optimization:

Stream PDF data instead of loading entire file
Support for partial content requests
Cache PDF data in browser storage
6. Browser Compatibility
Advantages of PDF.js:

Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
No plugins required
Handles CORS properly
Built-in security features
Mobile-friendly touch gestures
7. Integration Points
Backend Requirements:

Ensure /api/orders/:id/proof serves PDF with proper headers
Add support for range requests for streaming
Implement proper CORS headers
Add cache control headers
Frontend Integration:

Replace current iframe approach
Integrate with existing order detail layout
Maintain responsive design
Add proper loading states
8. Security Considerations
PDF.js Benefits:

Runs in sandboxed environment
No external dependencies
Handles malformed PDFs safely
Content Security Policy compatible
9. Fallback Strategy
Progressive Enhancement:

Primary: Custom PDF.js viewer
Fallback 1: Browser's built-in PDF viewer (new tab)
Fallback 2: Direct download link
Fallback 3: "PDF not available" message
10. Implementation Libraries to Consider
Option 1: react-pdf (Recommended for speed)

npm install react-pdf pdfjs-dist
Mature React wrapper
Good documentation
Active maintenance
Built-in optimization
Option 2: PDF.js directly

npm install pdfjs-dist
Maximum control
Smaller bundle size
Custom UI implementation required
Option 3: @react-pdf-viewer/core

npm install @react-pdf-viewer/core @react-pdf-viewer/default-layout
Feature-rich out of the box
Plugin architecture
Good TypeScript support
Next Steps
Choose library (recommend react-pdf for balance of features/effort)
Create PDFViewer component with all controls
Replace iframe in order-detail.tsx
Add proper error handling and loading states
Test across browsers and devices
Optimize performance for large PDFs
This approach will provide a robust, cross-browser compatible PDF viewer that handles all the requirements while avoiding the iframe/CORS issues you're experiencing with Chrome.
