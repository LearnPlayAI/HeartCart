# Category Sidebar Navigation Implementation Roadmap

*Last updated: May 7, 2025*

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding a Takealot-style category sidebar navigation to TeeMeYou's e-commerce platform.

## Technical Considerations

1. **State Management**:

   - Measure impact on user engagement and conversions

## Post-Implementation Tasks

1. Create admin documentation for managing the category hierarchy
2. Prepare technical documentation for future maintenance
3. Implement A/B testing to measure impact on sales metrics
4. Consider future enhancements like personalized category recommendations
